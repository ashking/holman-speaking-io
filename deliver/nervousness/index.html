    <h1>
      <a href="index.html">Dealing with Nervousness</a>
    </h1>

    <p>I don&rsquo;t know of anyone who does a lot of public speaking and doesn&rsquo;t still get
nervous every time.</p>

<p>I talked about this to someone whose talks I greatly admire. He has a certain
confidence and ease onstage and in person that makes it hard to believe he has a
hard time with nervousness. I asked him about it and he admitted he can&rsquo;t eat
anything before he gives his talk. Even if he has a closing keynote at 5pm, then
6pm will be the first food he eats that day. Everyone is nervous.</p>

<h2>Dealing with nerves</h2>

<p>Nervousness impacts people differently. Whenever I&rsquo;d play a solo during high
school jazz band, I&rsquo;d sometimes start yawning. That&rsquo;s just how I coped: I get
very sleepy physically, probably as some defense to hide behind an external
barrier of nonchalance (meanwhile inside my head I was losing it). I didn&rsquo;t even
realize it at first: my director noticed during rehearsal once and said &ldquo;look at
him, he&rsquo;s yawning!&rdquo; which, if you&rsquo;re an aspiring high school jazz band director
take note, is a <em>horrible</em> thing to say to someone who is already very nervous
and now has to worry about not yawning of all things, sheesh.</p>

<p>Nerves are a good thing, though, and if there&rsquo;s anything I&rsquo;ve learned it&rsquo;s that
they do help you out. Many times they serve to put you on edge. My brain tends
to work much more quickly — and <em>better</em> — when I&rsquo;m nervous and on stage
(admittedly I think it takes some experience before nerves turn into an
advantage like that). Realizing that nervousness is a feeling designed to <em>help</em>
you rather than <em>hurt</em> you is a great first step. If you weren&rsquo;t nervous, it
means that you don&rsquo;t care about what&rsquo;s about to happen. If you don&rsquo;t care, then
get off the fucking stage.</p>

<p>Practice is the number one remedy, of course. Rehearsing is the practice of
reducing the amount of unknown in your life. You become more accustomed with
what you have to say, you expand your context around just the lines you planned
to say verbatim. You become more confident with ad libbing.</p>

<h2>Exponential decay</h2>

<p>You know how I said everyone gets nervous? That&rsquo;s true&hellip; to an extent. I&rsquo;ve
given a lot of talks over the last few years, and while the nervousness doesn&rsquo;t
ever go away, the <em>duration</em> of the nervousness does.</p>

<p>For the first few talks I gave, I was nervous from the first slide all the way
to the last slide. Every step was stressful. But as I gave more talks I realized
that it quickly started to halve. I&rsquo;d make it halfway through before I&rsquo;d get a
bit more confident. Then a quarter of the way. Now it&rsquo;s to the point where I
really only face the major portions of nervousness during the first few minutes
of a talk. I&rsquo;m not sure it&rsquo;s ever going to get better than that (and I still
haven&rsquo;t figured out a way to reduce the nerves in the hours and days during the
lead-up to the talk), but realizing that I was getting better at it was a pretty
huge comfort. As with everything, if you do it enough times you just become more
comfortable with it.</p>

<p>There are ways you can cheat this process along, too. At my company we encourage
people to give run-throughs of their talks before they actually have to do it.
This is designed to be as realistic as possible, complete with projector and
podium and butts in seats. If you mess up, your coworkers will be nice about it
and will give you feedback at the end. Just getting you up on stage in front of
people — <em>any</em> people, even if they are your friends — is going to help cheat
the process along. You get a little bit more comfortable with every step you
take.</p>
