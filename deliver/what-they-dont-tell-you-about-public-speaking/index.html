    <h1>
      <a href="index.html">What They Don't Tell You</a>
    </h1>

    <p>Looking back on a year of speaking at conferences, I&rsquo;m rather flabbergasted that
I managed to make it without my pants falling off mid-sentence or my laptop
exploding in a fireball of self-doubt and international power cords.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;d read all the blog posts and heard all of the advice: slow down, speak
loudly, tell a story. But goddamn, no one told me I&rsquo;d have to put my laptop down
on the ground twenty feet away behind a couch because that&rsquo;s the only place the
projector&rsquo;s VGA cable would reach.</p>

<p>Turns out there&rsquo;s all this other stuff to worry about, too!</p>

<h2>The room isn&rsquo;t your audience</h2>

<p>When you&rsquo;re on stage in front of a few hundred people, your brain is screaming
at you <strong>DON&rsquo;T SCREW UP IN FRONT OF ALL THESE PEOPLE</strong>. But these people aren&rsquo;t
your main audience.</p>

<p>Run the numbers: most technology talks are in front of 50-300 people. That&rsquo;s
your most important audience; after all, they came to listen to <em>you</em>. But if
you post your talk online afterwards, you could reach thousands more. It&rsquo;s a
different audience. You can choose to ignore this audience completely, or you
can choose to embrace them.</p>

<p>Most conferences are a crap shoot when it comes to video. Half the time they
won&rsquo;t record your talk, and the other half of the time it may take months before
your talk is published.</p>

<p>Something I&rsquo;ve been <a href="http://zachholman.com/talk/git-github-secrets">doing</a>
<a href="http://zachholman.com/posts/how-github-works/">recently</a> is making a screen
recording of my talks using QuickTime on my Mac. It&rsquo;ll record both my voice and
my slides as I flip through them. It&rsquo;s a much better experience than just
posting contextless slides.</p>

<h2>Last-minute prep</h2>

<p>There are a number of things you&rsquo;ll want to take care of before jumping into
your talk:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Silence your phone</strong>. That means airplane mode or non-vibrate mode. You&rsquo;ll
(hopefully) be getting tweets or emails mentioning you during your talk; trust
me, feeling your pants vibrate will wreck your concentration.</li>
<li><strong>Crank up your screen brightness</strong>. You don&rsquo;t want to be fighting to read
your notes. You should be plugged in, anyway, so don&rsquo;t worry about draining your
battery.</li>
<li><strong>Rearrange your presenter display</strong>. Rather than just mirror your slides, you
should be using a separate presenter display that shows your slide, your next
slide, a timer, your notes, and anything else you&rsquo;d like to have up on-screen.
If you use Keynote, you can <a href="http://www.apple.com/findouthow/iwork/#keynote09-customizepresenter">customize this screen</a>.</li>
</ul>


<h2>Ground your talk in reality</h2>

<p>I&rsquo;ve done one or two talks that I thought were great ideas initially: projects
that weren&rsquo;t finished yet, things that I thought would be interesting to talk
about, and so on. They&rsquo;re talks I regret. Talks should always be <em>reactionary</em>
rather than <em>anticipatory</em>: they&rsquo;re going to come off as more natural, more
interesting, and above all, more valuable.</p>

<p>Think about writing a detailed blog post before you speak on any subject. That
way you&rsquo;ll know your comfort level with the information, and, more importantly,
you can gauge the reaction of everyone else. Is it interesting? Are you wrong?
Does anyone care?</p>

<h2>Your talk gets interesting when it&rsquo;s over</h2>

<p>My favorite part about talks are the questions afterwards (if your conference
allows it). Don&rsquo;t shy away from them. They&rsquo;re a great barometer of how well you
know your material, and, most importantly, whether your audience &ldquo;got it&rdquo;. If
you plan on giving your talk again, take special note of what happens in the
question-and-answer section. It&rsquo;s a goldmine for improving and changing your
talk for the next time through.</p>

<h2>Be excited</h2>

<p>There&rsquo;s one mistake I consistently see made by speakers both novice and
experienced: they&rsquo;re not <em>excited</em> about their talk. Changing this one thing
will completely, utterly change the perception of your talk for the better.</p>

<p>You&rsquo;re on stage, ostensibly talking about something that interests you or makes
your life better or saves you time. <strong>Be fucking excited about that</strong>. Let your
enthusiasm bleed through. People absolutely react to emotion. The opposite is
just as true: a passive voice on-stage will lead to a passive response by your
audience.</p>
