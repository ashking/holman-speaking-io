    <h1>
      <a href="index.html">Typography</a>
    </h1>

    <p>Typography is probably the biggest thing people fuck up.</p>

<p>Look. If you&rsquo;re using slides during your talk, they should <em>help</em> you out, not
fuck everything up. I have seen more slides that look like this than I have
heard jokes about my hometown of Fargo, North Dakota (and I have literally heard
all of them, yes including your clever woodchipper joke, although yes, that one
is my favorite too):</p>

<p><img src="http://cl.ly/image/120u3e130u0G/content" alt="" /></p>

<p>No one in the room can see this- even the brown-nosers in the front row.
Remember, most projectors you&rsquo;ll have to use are going to be terrible, most
people will be a minimum of 15 feet or more from you, and people at the back
could be hundreds of feet away from you. Miles, maybe. Kilomiles, for those who
use the metric system.</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s all that you need to know: you can&rsquo;t go too big, use a ton of
contrast, don&rsquo;t use many words, and choose a solid font. More than <em>anything
else on this entire site</em>, doing those four things right will put you in the
top 10% of speakers out there. People fuck this stuff up <em>all the time</em>.</p>

<h2>You can&rsquo;t go too big</h2>

<p>You really can&rsquo;t. I have yet to see a talk that made me think &ldquo;goddamn I can&rsquo;t
read this because the text is too big&rdquo;. If you string together four projectors
and combine them into a mega slide you <em>still</em> can&rsquo;t go big enough.</p>

<p>I wish more people would build their slide deck from the audience. That is, sit
in the very back of the room, hook up your laptop, and write your slides. If you
can&rsquo;t see what you&rsquo;re actually doing from back there, <em>neither can anybody
else</em>. You&rsquo;re at a severe advantage when you&rsquo;re a foot away from your screen,
clicking away.</p>

<p>You can&rsquo;t go big enough. Instead of this:</p>

<p><img src="http://cl.ly/image/3x2L2w033I0G/content" alt="" /></p>

<p>&hellip;you can do this:</p>

<p><img src="http://cl.ly/image/3Y1o3B0u3T3f/content" alt="" /></p>

<p>Did you catch what I did there? It was a little subtle, but I bumped the font
size up slightly. Remove words, make it bigger. You don&rsquo;t always have to take up
the entire slide, but the thing to note is that <em>you can&rsquo;t go too big</em>.</p>

<h2>Use a ton of contrast</h2>

<p>Remember my first example that makes me want to commit felonies?</p>

<p><img src="http://cl.ly/image/120u3e130u0G/content" alt="" /></p>

<p>Dark green on black is horrible because it doesn&rsquo;t have a lot of contrast. This
is especially important because again, the projector you use will probably be
terrible, and the room you present in will most likely not be a pitch black
darkroom. Unless you combine a strong dark color against a strong light color,
you&rsquo;re going to have a hard time getting your audience to easily see what you
wrote.</p>

<p>Black and white is usually a safe combination- it&rsquo;s one of those things that
it&rsquo;s hard to go wrong with something so basic. And that&rsquo;s a <em>good</em> thing.
Otherwise, look into <a href="../color/index.html">how you can select good colors</a> and design
that looks a bit more interesting.</p>

<h2>Don&rsquo;t use many words</h2>

<p>Remove words, make it bigger. It&rsquo;s a good policy to have. Part of designing a
good, legible slide deck is to reduce the amount of things on your slides as
much as possible.</p>

<p>That does two things for you: it makes it easier for your audience to parse
(which makes it more valuable to you), and it also means less time spent reading
for your audience. That&rsquo;s good for them, because no one actually wants to read
anything in life unless it&rsquo;s <em>50 Shades of Grey</em>, but it&rsquo;s most helpful for you,
since it means they&rsquo;ll spend more time listening to you. You want your slides to
accompany your talk, not be the focal point.</p>

<h2>Choose a solid font</h2>

<p>There are a lot of good fonts to choose. It&rsquo;s actually a fairly minor thing
compared to the other three aspects discussed here, but it can make a
difference.</p>

<p>Usually I&rsquo;ll try to pick something that looks clean and obvious at large font
sizes. Sans-serifs are often good choices, although serifs can work as well&hellip;
it all depends on how you use them.</p>

<p>If you&rsquo;re looking for something a bit different than your computer&rsquo;s default
fonts, try <a href="http://www.google.com/fonts">Google Fonts</a>. They have a slew of choices
and a clever interface to help you narrow down what&rsquo;s interesting to you. Other
really great sites include the <a href="http://losttype.com">Lost Type Co-op</a> and <a href="https://theleagueofmoveabletype.com">The
League of Moveable Type</a>.</p>
