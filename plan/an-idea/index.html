    <h1>
      <a href="index.html">The Idea</a>
    </h1>

    <p>Sometimes it&rsquo;s easy. You know that you&rsquo;re the world&rsquo;s foremost expert on the
brands of toothbrushes that Sinéad O'Connor used between 1988 and 1991. You know
that you can create a talk about her toothcare that is so poignant that it will
fundamentally make us rethink our station in life. You want to do this talk.</p>

<p><img src="http://cl.ly/image/342n3r3y3B1X/content" alt="sinead o'teeth" /></p>

<p>What if it&rsquo;s not that easy? What if you&rsquo;re not some eclectic expert on
something? You&rsquo;re interested in giving a talk, but what should you talk about?
It can be a little daunting.</p>

<p>First of all — and say this with me — most speakers are pretty stupid. Really!
They&rsquo;re no more special than you or me. They just have the advantage in two
areas:</p>

<ol>
<li>They&rsquo;ve done this particular something a lot</li>
<li>They want to talk about it</li>
</ol>


<p>That&rsquo;s it. And that can be you.</p>

<h2>Keep the focus small</h2>

<p>The best part is that you <em>can</em> be an expert in most things. You don&rsquo;t have to
give a talk that encompasses the entirety of the human condition: instead, focus
on something really, really, really small and start learning everything you can
about it. Your talk doesn&rsquo;t have to recap everything you&rsquo;ve ever learned in your
life; you can spend a few weeks looking at a small aspect of something that
interests you and talk about that.</p>

<p>What&rsquo;s more, <em>you don&rsquo;t actually have to be an expert</em>. I&rsquo;ve sat through
hundreds of talks from &ldquo;experts&rdquo; that were boring and terrible to live through.
I&rsquo;ve also listened to beginners talk about subject matter that I knew very well,
but it was <em>still interesting</em> to me because it made me rethink with fresh eyes
something that I had thought I had known all about. That&rsquo;s really what it&rsquo;s all
about: making your audience reconsider their own perspectives. You don&rsquo;t have to
be smarter than them or even be more correct than them to do that.</p>

<h2>What tickles your fancy</h2>

<p>Try to avoid starting with something you know nothing about. It&rsquo;ll bite you.
Instead, as you might expect, start with something that fascinates you. It
serves as a good foundation for future learning on the subject (and you most
certainly will learn as you build your talk: when it&rsquo;s your ass on stage, you
find yourself working hard to avoid potential embarassment if you can avoid it).</p>

<p>Make sure to have a little bit extra, too. You don&rsquo;t want to be stretching your
time while you&rsquo;re up on stage, because with nerves and fast talking you&rsquo;ll
probably end up under time anyway. You want to find a subject to talk about that
is a little meaty, so that even if you can&rsquo;t cover quite everything in your
talk, you can go over it in more detail in <a href="../../react/handling-questions/index.html">Q&amp;A</a>.</p>
