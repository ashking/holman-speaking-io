  <section class="content">
    <h1>
      <a href="index.html">Handling Questions</a>
    </h1>

    <p>You survived your talk. Congratulations! Every now and then a head of state gets
assassinated during their speech, so pat yourself on your back: you&rsquo;re already
better off than those unfortunate souls.</p>

<p>Don&rsquo;t crack that bottle of tequila open yet, though. If you&rsquo;re at a conference,
or definitely if you&rsquo;re giving a presentation to coworkers, you might have to
face your gravest challenge yet: the question and answer section.</p>

<p>Personally, I love Q&amp;A. I&rsquo;d rather give five minute talks and hour long Q&amp;A
sessions, but then again I also don&rsquo;t mind eating the cheese straight out of the
pouch in the Velveeta Mac and Cheese box, so your mileage may vary. Q&amp;A can be a
lot of fun because you&rsquo;re directly talking about things people care about, and
it helps you gauge what people are interested in in case you&rsquo;re giving this talk
again later on.</p>

<p>There&rsquo;s always some shit you have to deal with, though:</p>

<h2>Dealing with not understanding a question</h2>

<p>New speakers freak out about Q&amp;A for a number of odd reasons, but the main thing
you&rsquo;ll end up worrying about? Not understanding what the hell you&rsquo;re being
asked.</p>

<p>You&rsquo;re up in front of everyone. Sometimes you&rsquo;re in the spotlight, which makes
it hard to see who&rsquo;s asking the question. Sometimes the person asking the
question doesn&rsquo;t have a microphone. Sometimes the person asking the question has
a heavy accent or isn&rsquo;t a native speaker. Sometimes you&rsquo;re just stressed out
from your talk that your fried brain won&rsquo;t have the faintest idea of what the
questioner is talking about.</p>

<p>With all of these things the same rules always apply. They all sound stupid,
now, while you&rsquo;re reading this, but you&rsquo;ll be amazed about what you&rsquo;ll forget
when you&rsquo;re on-stage after a talk. The rules:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Ask them to repeat the question</strong>. The easiest and simplest thing. Usually
if you can&rsquo;t hear the question, it&rsquo;s almost certain the audience can&rsquo;t, either
(which is a good reason to repeat the question, too). Repeating the question
doesn&rsquo;t make you look like a douche: it makes you look like someone who cares
enough to get it right or, heaven forbid, someone who just didn&rsquo;t catch the
question the first time around.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Have them ask you privately afterwards</strong>. Still don&rsquo;t have the foggiest idea
of what&rsquo;s going on? Just ask them to chat with you after. It lets you talk to
them in more detail, and it&rsquo;s perfectly fine not to bother the rest of the
audience with more back-and-forth.</p></li>
</ul>


<h2>Dealing with fucking up</h2>

<p>Even after all the prep in the world, sometimes you fuck up. You say something
you didn&rsquo;t intend, or you&rsquo;re just wrong about something. There&rsquo;s always going to
be someone in the audience who will try to correct you.</p>

<p>If what they&rsquo;re saying sounds right, or you&rsquo;re not sure what&rsquo;s true and what&rsquo;s
false anymore, just cop up to it. &ldquo;Whoa, I didn&rsquo;t know that&rdquo; is a big
concession, and it makes you look like someone open to new ideas. It&rsquo;s not bad
to be a flip flopper. Sometimes you&rsquo;re just going to be wrong.</p>

<h2>Dealing with questions that aren&rsquo;t questions</h2>

<p>This almost always happens at least once at every conference I&rsquo;ve been at. You
know the type: the dude in the back who&rsquo;s already 75 seconds into his &ldquo;question&rdquo;
and yet you still haven&rsquo;t heard anything remotely close to what could be
considered a question in fact you&rsquo;re pretty sure this smug jerkhole doesn&rsquo;t have
a question and you mostly just want to punch him in the ever-flapping mouth.</p>

<p>Snap out of it. You have a microphone. Use it. <em>Do you have an actual
question?</em>, when said properly, is probably the funniest thing for the rest of
the audience to hear ever. You don&rsquo;t have to be a jerk about it: just ask them
if they&rsquo;re going to get to the point. If you&rsquo;re irritated, I guarantee the rest
of the audience is a heartbeat away from mob justice themselves.</p>

<p>Just be nice and you&rsquo;re going to be fine.</p>

<h2>Dealing with assholes</h2>

<p>You&rsquo;re really not going to run into assholes very often. People worry about the
rogue troll in the audience, but typically human beings are pretty timid,
respectful creatures.</p>

<p>Every now and then, though, someone may challenge what you said in a rude
manner. Again, remember that you have the mic, and more importantly, you are
literally in a position of power: you&rsquo;re up on stage, under the lights, in front
of the room, whatever. Stay classy and you&rsquo;re going to win the argument. You
return the snideness back at them and you&rsquo;ve lost the battle of public opinion.</p>

<p>When in doubt, defuse, concede some ground as a good-natured way of letting the
jerk feel like they&rsquo;ve won something, and move on to the next question. In a
conference, organizers will likely help you with this, as they&rsquo;ll want to avoid
confrontation too.</p>

<p>You&rsquo;re not trying to win over the asshole; who wants another asshole, anyway?
You&rsquo;re fighting to make everyone else in the room think to themselves &ldquo;god I
don&rsquo;t even care about this anymore, fuck this weirdo HE STILL HASN&rsquo;T EVEN ASKED
A QUESTION YET&rdquo;.</p>

<p>Don&rsquo;t pick a battle with someone who buys ink by the barrel, and don&rsquo;t pick a
battle with someone who&rsquo;s up on stage and who has been talking for awhile. You
have all the power, and you&rsquo;ll win anyway.</p>
