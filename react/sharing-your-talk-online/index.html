    <h1>
      <a href="index.html">Sharing Your Talk Online</a>
    </h1>

    <p>So there&rsquo;s this thing called the internet and it&rsquo;s filled with people who hate
everything you stand for and probably would like to say mean things to you (but
only on the internet and not to your face). Cool! Let&rsquo;s feed the fire!</p>

<h2>Posting your slides</h2>

<p>It&rsquo;s up to you whether you want to put your slide deck online. For some people,
giving a talk is a personal thing, and they don&rsquo;t want to share with people who
weren&rsquo;t actually in the room with them. Makes sense.</p>

<p>For others, it can be interesting. Ignoring the trolls, there <em>are</em> a lot of
fine, upstanding people on the internet, and it can be a real rush to see people
having an interesting discussion based on something <em>you</em> created. It&rsquo;s like the
Q&amp;A session you might have had after your talk, except multiplied thousands of
times over. It can be fun to engage in these conversations.</p>

<p>The very basic thing you can do is put your slides on a slide sharing website
like <a href="https://speakerdeck.com">Speaker Deck</a>. Depending on the talk, slides can
still be very valuable on their own, even without your voice alongside them.
After all, it&rsquo;s quicker to read than it is to listen.</p>

<h2>Posting your talk</h2>

<p>It&rsquo;s helpful to go the extra distance, though. Ideally, your audience online
should get just as much context as the audience in your room.</p>

<p>One thing you can do is <a href="../../prep/recording-your-talk/index.html">record your voice</a> while you
flip through your talk. You can either do this during your practice runs or, if
you want the &ldquo;real deal&rdquo;, record it as you give it in front of a live studio
audience.</p>

<p>Finally, you can also get yourself recorded. A lot of conferences will take
video of their speakers nowadays, and will post it on YouTube or Vimeo or their
own sites. This is a really good approach, but just be warned: it can sometimes
take conferences months and months before they get all their video rendered and
cleaned up. It&rsquo;s not trivial thing.</p>

<h2>Expanding on your talk</h2>

<p>There&rsquo;s a few intrepid souls that go even further. Rather than just try to mimic
the talk environment online, they go to greater lengths to make sure the
<em>online</em> experience is actually the superset of experiences.</p>

<p>For example, <a href="https://twitter.com/rtomayko">Ryan Tomayko</a> gave a talk called
<em>The Shell Hater&rsquo;s Handbook</em>, which explained the POSIX shell to beginners.
Afterwards, he <a href="http://shellhaters.heroku.com">published a companion website</a>
that had the video of his talk, his slide deck, and then on top of all of that,
a <a href="http://tomayko.com/writings/awkward-ruby">separate blog post</a> that expands on
some of the things he talked about in his talk. Finally, he made a <a href="http://shellhaters.heroku.com/posix">reference
page</a> for all the POSIX utilities you might
be interested in after all that. He created an experience that was more valuable
than just regurgitating the talk video.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve seen people do similar things with their slide deck. They&rsquo;ll split up most
of their slides into separate images, and then write a paragraph or two that
describes what was said about that particular slide. This is a lot of work
(which is the reason I haven&rsquo;t quite gone that far on my own talks), but it&rsquo;s
really makes a difference while reading it.</p>

<p>Want something a bit less time-consuming? Instead of just tweeting a link to
your slide deck, make a quick website and add a 4-8 paragraph introduction to
your slide deck so people get a better context of what they&rsquo;re getting into.
Best bang for your buck.</p>
